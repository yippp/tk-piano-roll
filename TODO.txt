NEXT

+ do something about notes being drawn on top of one another
+ keep viewing area still while zooming
+ draw only rects intersecting or contained in the visible area
+ use absolute snapping as default (relative snapping optional)
+ lines being drawn incorrectly, see visibleregion and max_subdiv

SOLVED

- with 1/16th snap bar lines are always being drawn at canvas(x)
= rects get dragged out of grid area with subdiv values lower than 4
